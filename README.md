A simple Web-based SCXML simulation environment. Currently hosted live [here](http://live.echo-flow.com/scion-web-simulation-environment/). For a demo, visit [here](http://goo.gl/wG5cq).

This project is based on the following libraries:
* [scxml-viz](https://github.com/jbeard4/scxml-viz) for visualizing the SCXML document
* [SCION](https://github.com/jbeard4/SCION) for executing the SCXML document

For an example of how to integrate scxml-viz and SCION into a live Web user interface, see this [js-fiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/jbeard4/7Dvgm/2/).

For an example of how to integrate scxml-viz and SCION into node.js application, see [scion-shell](https://github.com/jbeard4/scion-shell).
